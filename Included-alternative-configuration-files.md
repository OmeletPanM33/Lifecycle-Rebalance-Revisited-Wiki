There are four presets in the mod's directory (`Steam\SteamApps\workshop\content\255710\2027161563`); to use of these, copy it to your [local settings directory](https://github.com/algernon-A/Lifecycle-Rebalance-Revisited/wiki/Configuration-files) and rename it WG_CitizenEdit.xml (after first deleting any existing WG_CitizenEdit.xml file in that location).

The preset files function as follows:
* **WG_CarAsWealth.xml**: car usage is based off wealth levels (higher wealth levels means more car usage); overall, the car usage is quite high.
* **WG_CarHeavy.xml**: very heavy car usage for low-density residential areas.
* **WG_CitizenEdit.xml**: mod default settings; car usage for low-density residential areas is much higher than the game defaults, but car usage for high-density residential areas is a bit lower than the game default.
* **WG_GameDefaults.xml**: game default settings.
