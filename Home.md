### Mod background
Lifecycle Rebalance Revisited is the official continuation of Whitefang Greytail's (now deprecated) Citizen Lifecycle Rebalance v2.6 mod, which in turn was created in order to support Whitefang Greytail's Realistic Population and Consumption mod (that mod is also now deprecated and is continued with [Realistic Population Revisited](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2025147082)).

### This wiki
This wiki is currently under initial development.  So far, I've successfully resisted the urge to put up a mid-90's 'Geocities'-style 'Under construction' logo here.
