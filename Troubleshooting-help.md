If you're having difficulties with the mod, there's a number of basic troubleshooting steps to try:
* Can you see the mod in the Cities: Skylines content manager mod settings?  If not, it may be a Steam Workshop download issue.  Try unsubscribing and resubscribing to the mod.
* Have you activated the mod in the Cities: Skylines content manager mod settings?  All in-game mods need to be manually activated before they can work.
* Are your mod settings correct for what you want?  For example, if you've got your sickness probabilities set to the maximum, of course this mod is going to make a lot of your citizens sick.  If in doubt, delete your [configuration files](https://github.com/algernon-A/Lifecycle-Rebalance-Revisited/wiki/Configuration-files) to reset to the game defaults.
* If you're still having problems, check for any outdated mods.  The [Mod Compatibility Checker](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2034713132) is great for this, and there's also the invaluable [list of broken and incompatible mods](url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mVFkj_7ij4FLzKs2QJaONNmb9Z-SRqUeG6xFGqEX1ew/htmlview) by AquilaSol and Avanya.
* Running the [Duplicate Assembly Scanner](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2013398705) can also help, especially if you have another mod using an outdated version of Harmony.
* The [custom logging options](https://github.com/algernon-A/Lifecycle-Rebalance-Revisited/wiki/Custom-logging) can help identify the impacts of any problems, and may be required to help troubleshoot further.
* If you're still having problems after curating your mods list, then the best place to ask for help is on the [mod's Steam Workshop page](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2027161563).  Note that (at a minimum) you will probably be asked to provide your output_log.txt; please see [this guide](url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=46364593) on output logs and common errors for more details on what that is and how to find it.  You may also be asked to provide any custom log files that might be relevant to your situation.
