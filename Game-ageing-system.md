### Citizen ageing
The game has an internal counter for citizen age (not years). The counter updates once per 'simulation step' for that citizen.  Previously undefined, the 1.13 game update (Sunset Harbor) introduced a conversion rate of 3.5 age units per year (e.g. a citizen with age 35 is 10 years old).

According to default behaviour, chidren become teens at 15 age units (4.3 years!), teens become young adults at 45 units (12.9 years), young adults become adults at 90 units (25.7 years), and adults become seniors at 180 units (51.4 years).

After the 1.13 update, citizens now die randomly between 240 and 400(!), depending on how healthy they are (level of healthcare provided).  Prior to 1.13, citizens would all die instantly at 240, which was one factor that create the infamous huge 'deathwaves' that plagued the vanilla game prior to 1.13.  While the 1.13 death age changes have reduced the severity of those deathwaves, the underlying problem is still there (and is addressed by this mod).

(A side-effect of the 1.13 changes was a significant increase in the number of seniors; with a healthy senior population, an unmodded Sunset Harbor game will see over twice the number of seniors than an unmodded pre-Sunset Harbor game.  This threw a large number of existing cities out of balance and caused a lot of player frustration).

### Mod calculations
Prior to the definition of 3.5 age-units-per-year (AUPY) introduced in 1.13, the original WG mod assumed 2.5 AUPY.  This original behaviour is replicated by the 'legacy calculations' option of this mod; the 'Sunset Harbor calculations' use the game value of 3.5 AUPY.
